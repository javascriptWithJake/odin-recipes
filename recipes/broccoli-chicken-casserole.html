    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A deliciously creamy chicken, broccoli, and stuffing casserole with shredded chicken and 
        tender broccoli in a cheesy mushroom sauce. Use your favorite stuffing mix to sprinkle 
        over top for a crunchy, flavorful topping. Use leftover chicken or turkey to speed up prep 
        time even more.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbellâ€™s)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 pound broccoli florets, cooked</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup dry stuffing mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in a large pot and add enough water to completely cover 
            the chicken in liquid; bring to a gentle simmer. Cover tightly with a lid and cook 
            until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and cut into bite-sized pieces when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Mix together condensed soup and mayonnaise in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer cooked broccoli over top, then 
            soup mixture, and finally Cheddar cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle dry stuffing mix over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese has melted, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
